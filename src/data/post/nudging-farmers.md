## Reducing Water Pollution via Nitrogen Fertilizer Optimization

In recent years, the environmental impact of agricultural practices has become a central topic in policy discussions. One of the critical issues is nitrogen runoff from fertilizer, which significantly contributes to water pollution.

This article explores how behavioral "nudges" can be effectively employed to encourage farmers to optimize their nitrogen fertilizer usage. By providing timely information and peer comparisons, we can influence-making without imposing strict regulations.

### Key Findings

- **Information Gaps**: Many farmers lack real-time data on soil nitrogen levels.
- **Peer Comparison**: Showing farmers how their usage compares to neighbors can drive efficiency.
- **Economic Benefits**: optimizing fertilizer use not only helps the environment but also reduces costs for the farmers.

Stay tuned for the full publication and data analysis.
